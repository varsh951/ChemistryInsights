<h1>Global Mannanase Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>Mannanase market</strong> is projected to experience significant growth between 2024 and 2030, driven by increasing demand across various industrial applications. Mannanase enzymes have become indispensable in industries ranging from animal feed to food processing, owing to their ability to break down complex polysaccharides efficiently.</p><p><strong>1. Rising Demand in Animal Feed Applications:</strong><br>
The animal nutrition sector accounts for over 65% of mannanase consumption globally. With livestock producers facing <strong>increasing feed costs and stringent regulations</strong>, enzyme supplementation has become crucial to improve feed conversion rates. Recent trials demonstrate <strong>5-12% improvements in poultry weight gain</strong> when using mannanase-enhanced feed formulations.</p><p><strong>2. Expanding Food &amp; Beverage Industry Utilization:</strong><br>
Food processors are adopting mannanase for applications including juice clarification and dough conditioning. The enzyme's ability to modify viscosity and improve texture has led to its inclusion in <strong>23% more food products</strong> since 2020. Particularly in baking applications, mannanase helps achieve <strong>15-20% better volume and crumb structure</strong> in whole grain products.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
