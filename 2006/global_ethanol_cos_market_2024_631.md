<h1>Global Ethanol Co-Products Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The <strong>global ethanol co-products market</strong> is projected to expand at a moderate <strong>CAGR of 5.2% from 2024 to 2030</strong>, driven by expanding biofuel mandates and rising demand for sustainable animal feed ingredients. These co-products - primarily distillers grains and corn oil - form crucial revenue streams for ethanol producers while addressing growing needs across feed, biofuel and industrial applications.</p><p><strong>1. Biofuel Policy Momentum:</strong><br>
Global ethanol production exceeded <strong>110 billion liters in 2023</strong>, creating massive co-product volumes. With over <strong>65 countries implementing biofuel blending mandates</strong>, ethanol output and associated co-products will continue rising to meet decarbonization goals, particularly in transportation sectors.</p><p><strong>2. Protein Shortages &amp; Livestock Demand:</strong><br>
Distillers grains now supply <strong>30% of protein in U.S. livestock rations</strong>, with exports to China and Southeast Asia growing at <strong>12% annually</strong>. The valuable amino acid profile and cost advantage over soybean meal makes these co-products indispensable for animal nutrition.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
