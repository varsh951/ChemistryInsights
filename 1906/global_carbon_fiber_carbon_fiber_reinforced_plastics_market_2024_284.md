<h1>Global Carbon Fiber and Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>carbon fiber and carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 23.45 billion in 2024 to USD 34.56 billion by 2030</strong>, registering a steady <strong>CAGR of 6.7% during the forecast period</strong>, according to a comprehensive new industry analysis. This growth trajectory is fueled by expanding applications across <strong>aerospace, automotive, and renewable energy sectors</strong> where performance-to-weight ratio is critical.</p><p>Carbon fiber compositesâengineered materials combining carbon fibers with polymer matricesâhave become indispensable for modern manufacturing due to their <strong>exceptional strength-to-weight characteristics, corrosion resistance, and design flexibility</strong>. These advanced materials are revolutionizing industries ranging from <strong>commercial aviation to high-performance sports equipment</strong> and next-generation automotive solutions.</p><p><strong>1. Aerospace Industry's Lightweighting Imperative:</strong><br>
With commercial aviation accounting for <strong>42% of global carbon fiber consumption</strong>, aircraft manufacturers continue driving demand. The latest generation aircraft like Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 now incorporate <strong>50-53% CFRP</strong> by weight, while research indicates next-gen models may push this to 60% by 2028. This shift delivers <strong>20-25% fuel efficiency gains</strong>âa critical advantage given tightening emissions regulations.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

Electric vehicle manufacturers are adopting CFRP to offset battery weight, with premium models now averaging <strong>80-120kg of carbon fiber components</strong> per vehicle. The EV boom helped automotive CFRP demand grow at <strong>9.2% CAGR over 2020-2024</strong>, outpacing the broader composite materials market.</p><p><strong>3. Renewable Energy Infrastructure Expansion:</strong><br>
Wind turbine blade manufacturing consumed <strong>28,000 metric tons of carbon fiber</strong> in 2023, representing one of the fastest-growing segments. As blade lengths exceed 100 meters for offshore installations, demand for high-modulus fibers is expected to <strong>triple by 2030</strong> according to industry projections.</p><p>Despite strong growth fundamentals, several obstacles require navigation:</p><p><strong>Production Cost Constraints:</strong> Precursor costs account for <strong>51% of carbon fiber production expenses</strong>, creating pricing volatility. While PAN-based fibers dominate (capturing 92% market share), manufacturers are investing heavily in alternative precursors to reduce costs by <strong>30-35%</strong> through 2030.</p><p><strong>Recycling Infrastructure Gaps:</strong> Less than <strong>12% of CFRP waste currently gets recycled</strong> due to technical complexities. Emerging pyrolysis and solvolysis technologies show promise but require scalingâthe European CFRP recycling market alone needs <strong>USD 850 million in infrastructure investment</strong> to meet 2030 targets.</p><p><strong>Workforce Skill Shortages:</strong> The advanced composites sector faces a <strong>38% deficit in qualified technicians</strong> for layup and molding operations, forcing companies to develop proprietary training programs that add <strong>18-22% to labor costs</strong>.</p><p><strong>1. Urban Air Mobility (UAM) Development:</strong><br>
The emerging eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft market, projected to reach <strong>USD 28 billion by 2030</strong>, requires airframes comprising <strong>70-90% CFRP</strong>. This nascent sector is already consuming <strong>2,300 metric tons annually</strong> in prototyping and certification vehicles.</p><p><strong>2. Next-Gen Pressure Vessel Applications:</strong><br>
Type IV hydrogen storage tanksâcritical for fuel cell vehiclesâare driving demand for carbon fiber in the energy sector. Prototype tanks now achieve <strong>700-bar working pressures</strong> with CFRP reinforcement, spurring <strong>42% annual growth</strong> in this application segment.</p><p><strong>3. Digital Manufacturing Advancements:</strong><br>
Automated fiber placement (AFP) and 3D printing technologies are reducing CFRP component production time by <strong>55-60%</strong> while cutting material waste to under <strong>5%</strong>. These innovations are making carbon fiber solutions viable for <strong>medium-volume production</strong> (10,000-50,000 units annually).</p><p><strong>Regional Supply Chain Localization:</strong><br>
	Major manufacturers are establishing CFRP production facilities near end markets. Recent examples include Toray's <strong>USD 500 million South Carolina expansion</strong> and SGL Carbon's <strong>German mega-line for automotive composites</strong>âboth aiming to reduce logistics costs by 18-25%.</p><p><strong>Hybrid Material Systems:</strong><br>
	Combining carbon fiber with other advanced materials (such as basalt fibers or graphene-enhanced resins) is yielding composites with <strong>multi-functional properties</strong>âincluding integrated sensing capabilities and improved thermal management.</p><p><strong>Industrialization of Out-of-Autoclave Processes:</strong><br>
	Manufacturers are adopting OoA (out-of-autoclave) technologies that reduce energy consumption by <strong>60% compared to traditional curing methods</strong>, while maintaining 95-98% of mechanical properties.</p><p>The market remains <strong>highly concentrated</strong>, with <strong>Toray Industries, Mitsubishi Chemical, and Hexcel</strong> collectively controlling <strong>58% of global carbon fiber production capacity</strong>. These leaders continue expanding through:<br>
<br>
- <strong>Vertical integration</strong> (Toray's USD 1.1 billion Zoltek acquisition)<br>
- <strong>Joint ventures</strong> (Hyosung and BASF's automotive composites partnership)<br>
- <strong>Technology specialization</strong> (SGL Carbon's focus on large-tow industrial fibers)</p><p>Emerging players like China's <strong>Jiangsu Hengshen and Weihai Guangwei</strong> are gaining share through <strong>state-backed capacity expansions</strong> and competitive pricing strategiesânow representing <strong>19% of global production</strong>.</p><p><strong>By Fiber Type:</strong></p><p><em>PAN-based Carbon Fiber</em> (dominant 92% share)</p><p><em>Pitch-based Carbon Fiber</em> (specialty applications)</p><p><strong>By Product Form:</strong></p><p><em>Continuous Fiber Composites</em></p><p><em>Chopped Fiber Composites</em></p><p><em>Woven Fabric Composites</em></p><p><strong>By Application:</strong></p><p><em>Aerospace &amp; Defense</em> (largest share)</p><p><em>Automotive</em></p><p><em>Wind Energy</em></p><p><em>Sporting Goods</em></p><p><em>Construction &amp; Infrastructure</em></p><p><strong>North America:</strong> Mature aerospace sector driving demand; U.S. accounts for 61% of regional market</p><p><strong>Europe:</strong> Leader in automotive and wind energy applications; Germany and France at forefront</p><p><strong>Asia-Pacific:</strong> Fastest-growing region (9.1% CAGR) led by China's industrial expansion</p><p><strong>Middle East:</strong> Emerging hub for CFRP production with sovereign wealth fund investments</p><p>This analysis is based on the newly published <em>Global Carbon Fiber and Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics Market Research Report (2024-2030)</em>.
