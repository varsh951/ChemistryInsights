<h1>Dichloromethane Price Trend, Spot Prices, Historical and Forecast Price Movement Charts, 2025 Editio</h1><p>The global <strong>dichloromethane (DCM) market</strong> is witnessing significant price fluctuations across regions, driven by <strong>varying industrial demand, production capacities, and raw material dynamics</strong>. According to recent market analysis, North American prices remain relatively stable at <strong>$980-$1,050/ton</strong> as of Q2 2024, while Asia-Pacific experiences volatility with Chinese spot prices ranging between <strong>2,640-2,680 RMB/ton</strong> in Shandong province, reflecting a <strong>7.25% weekly decline</strong> in January 2024.</p><p><strong>1. Pharmaceutical Industry Demand:</strong><br>
The pharmaceutical sector accounts for <strong>28% of global DCM consumption</strong>, utilizing it as a solvent in API manufacturing and drug formulation. With expanding pharmaceutical production in India (growing at <strong>9.4% annually</strong>) and China, demand remains resilient despite price pressures.</p><p><strong>2. Paint &amp; Coatings Sector Expansion:</strong><br>
DCM's role as a paint stripper and cleaning agent drives steady demand, particularly in North America where the coatings market is projected to grow at <strong>4.3% CAGR through 2026</strong>. However, environmental regulations are pushing manufacturers toward greener alternatives in this segment.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
