<h1>Global PEM Fuel Cell Gas Diffusion Layer Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>The global <strong>PEM fuel cell gas diffusion layer market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 1.2 billion in 2024 to USD 2.8 billion by 2030</strong>, expanding at an impressive <strong>CAGR of 15.2%</strong>, according to latest industry analysis. This accelerated growth trajectory is driven by surging demand for clean energy solutions and accelerating adoption of hydrogen fuel cell technologies across transportation and stationary power applications.</p><p>Gas diffusion layers (GDLs) â the critical component enabling oxygen diffusion and water management in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells â are witnessing technological advancements that enhance <strong>durability, conductivity, and mass transport properties</strong>. These improvements are making fuel cells increasingly viable for <strong>heavy-duty mobility, backup power systems, and distributed generation</strong> applications.</p><p><strong>1. Hydrogen Economy Expansion:</strong><br>
With over <strong>30 countries</strong> implementing national hydrogen strategies and <strong>USD 70+ billion</strong> committed to hydrogen infrastructure globally, GDL demand is surging. The transportation sector alone accounted for <strong>62% of GDL market volume</strong> in 2023, driven by fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) adoption in commercial fleets.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
