<h1>Drywall Compound and Drywall Mud Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>The global <strong>drywall compound and drywall mud market</strong> is projected to expand from <strong>USD 1.69 billion in 2023 to USD 2.6 billion by 2032</strong>, growing at a steady <strong>CAGR of 4.9% during 2025â2032</strong>, according to a comprehensive new market analysis. This growth reflects the continued expansion of construction activities worldwide, coupled with increasing demand for efficient drywall finishing solutions across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors.</p><p>Drywall mudâalso known as joint compoundâremains the essential material for creating seamless wall surfaces in modern construction. Its versatility extends from initial drywall installation to final decorative finishes, providing builders with cost-effective solutions that meet increasingly stringent quality standards. The product's dominance in interior construction stems from its workability, drying time optimization, and compatibility with various finishing techniques.</p><p><strong>1. Construction Industry Expansion:</strong><br>
Global construction output is expected to reach <strong>$15.2 trillion by 2030</strong>, with residential construction accounting for 38% of sector growth. This expansion directly correlates with drywall compound demand, as modern construction methods increasingly favor drywall over traditional plaster. In North America alone, drywall installers report <strong>12-15% annual increases</strong> in material consumption since 2021.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

Aging housing stock in North America and Europe is driving significant remodeling activity. In the U.S., home improvement spending exceeded <strong>$485 billion in 2023</strong>, with drywall repairs and renovations representing 11% of total projects. This trend benefits the drywall mud market as homeowners and contractors seek high-performance patching and finishing compounds.</p><p><strong>3. Premiumization of Building Materials:</strong><br>
The construction industry's shift toward specialized formulations has created demand for <strong>low-dust, low-VOC, and mold-resistant compounds</strong>. Premium products now command 28-35% price premiums while growing at <strong>7.2% CAGR</strong>âsignificantly outpacing conventional products. Manufacturers are responding with innovative formulations that reduce labor time while improving finish quality.</p><p>While the outlook remains positive, several factors require careful navigation:</p><p><strong>Raw Material Volatility:</strong> Gypsum prices have shown <strong>18-22% annual fluctuations</strong> since 2020, squeezing manufacturer margins. Transportation costs, representing <strong>12-15% of final product cost</strong>, remain susceptible to fuel price shocks and supply chain disruptions.</p><p><strong>Skilled Labor Shortages:</strong> The construction industry's <strong>650,000-worker deficit in North America</strong> impacts proper drywall application, sometimes leading to material waste. This has accelerated demand for user-friendly compounds that accommodate varying skill levels.</p><p><strong>Alternative Wall Systems:</strong> Emerging technologies like 3D-printed walls and modular panel systems threaten to capture <strong>8-12% of the traditional drywall market</strong> by 2030. However, these alternatives still require finishing compounds for seamless integration.</p><p><strong>1. Asia-Pacific Infrastructure Boom:</strong><br>
China's construction sector is projected to account for <strong>26% of global activity by 2027</strong>, with India and Southeast Asia following closely. Localized product development is crucial, as regional preferences vary from lightweight compounds for high-rises to moisture-resistant formulations for tropical climates.</p><p><strong>2. Green Building Certifications:</strong><br>
With <strong>48% of builders</strong> now prioritizing LEED or equivalent certifications, demand has surged for sustainable drywall compounds. Products with recycled content, reduced carbon footprints, and improved indoor air quality credentials are gaining market share <strong>3-5 times faster</strong> than conventional alternatives.</p><p><strong>3. Digital Transformation:</strong><br>
The adoption of construction software for material estimation has reduced drywall waste by <strong>15-18% on job sites</strong>. Manufacturers integrating with these platforms through API connections or proprietary apps are seeing <strong>20-25% faster customer acquisition</strong> in the professional contractor segment.</p><p><strong>Application-Specific Formulations:</strong><br>
	Product differentiation has intensified with specialized compounds for veneer plastering, texture finishing, and fire-rated assemblies. The fire-resistant segment alone is growing at <strong>9.3% CAGR</strong> as building codes evolve.</p><p><strong>Packaging Innovations:</strong><br>
	Contractors increasingly favor <strong>resealable pouches and ergonomic tubs</strong> that reduce product skinning and waste. Lightweight packaging now represents <strong>42% of retail sales</strong>, up from 28% in 2020.</p><p><strong>Regional Manufacturing Strategies:</strong><br>
	Major players are establishing <strong>local production facilities</strong> within 300 miles of key markets to reduce logistics costs and carbon footprints. This trend accelerated post-pandemic, with <strong>14 new regional plants</strong> opening in North America and Europe since 2021.</p><p>The market features a mix of global conglomerates and regional specialists. <strong>USG Corporation (now part of Knauf)</strong> leads with <strong>28% market share</strong>, followed by <strong>Saint-Gobain (20%)</strong> and <strong>National Gypsum (15%)</strong>. These industry titans compete through extensive distribution networks and contractor training programs, while regional players like <strong>Murco and Freeman</strong> dominate specific geographic markets with tailored product lines.</p><p>The competitive landscape is shifting as manufacturers invest in <strong>digital tools for contractors</strong>, including mobile apps for product selection, augmented reality for finishing techniques, and IoT-enabled inventory management. These technological differentiators are becoming as important as product performance in winning large commercial contracts.</p><p><strong>By Product Type:</strong></p><p><em>Setting-Type Compounds</em> (fastest growing segment)</p><p><em>Ready-Mixed Compounds</em> (largest volume)</p><p><em>Lightweight All-Purpose</em></p><p><strong>By Application:</strong></p><p><em>New Construction</em> (60% share)</p><p><em>Repair &amp; Remodeling</em></p><p><em>Commercial Interiors</em></p><p><strong>By End User:</strong></p><p><em>Professional Contractors</em> (primary market)</p><p><em>DIY Consumers</em> (growing segment)</p><p><strong>North America:</strong> Mature but steady market driven by housing starts and commercial retrofits. The U.S. accounts for <strong>82% of regional demand</strong>.</p><p><strong>Europe:</strong> Stringent building regulations have stimulated innovation in eco-friendly compounds. Germany and France lead in adopting low-VOC formulations.</p><p><strong>Asia-Pacific:</strong> The engine of global growth, with China and India collectively representing <strong>41% of new demand</strong> through 2032.</p><p><strong>Latin America:</strong> Brazil and Mexico show promise as urbanization accelerates, though market growth remains sensitive to economic cycles.</p><p>This press release summarizes findings from the comprehensive report <em>Global Drywall Compound and Drywall Mud Market Outlook 2025-2032</em>.
