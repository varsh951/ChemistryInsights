<h1>Middle East Acoustic Plasterboard Market Research Report 2024-2030</h1><p>The <strong>Middle East Acoustic Plasterboard market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 113.2 million in 2024 to USD 157.6 million by 2030</strong>, registering a steady <strong>CAGR of 5.6% during the forecast period (2024-2030)</strong>, according to a comprehensive market analysis. This growth is fueled by rising construction activities, stringent noise regulations, and increasing awareness of soundproofing solutions across commercial and residential sectors.</p><p>Acoustic plasterboardâa specialized gypsum board engineered for sound absorptionâhas become indispensable in modern construction projects. Its ability to reduce noise pollution while maintaining structural integrity makes it ideal for <strong>office spaces, educational institutions, healthcare facilities, and high-end residential developments</strong> across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.</p><p><strong>1. Construction Boom and Urbanization:</strong><br>
With <strong>$1.3 trillion worth of active construction projects</strong> across the Middle East, acoustic solutions are seeing unprecedented demand. The UAE alone accounts for <strong>38% of regional plasterboard consumption</strong>, driven by megaprojects like Dubai Urban Tech District and Saudi Arabia's NEOM.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

New building codes in Qatar (2023) and updated UAE Fire and Life Safety Code (2024) mandate <strong>minimum 50dB sound insulation</strong> for residential wallsâa requirement easily met by high-performance acoustic plasterboards. Compliance-driven demand grew <strong>22% in 2023</strong> compared to previous year.</p><p><strong>3. Hospitality and Healthcare Sector Expansion:</strong><br>
Hospitality projects under Saudi Vision 2030 require specialized acoustic solutions serving <strong>83% of upcoming luxury hotels</strong>. Meanwhile, GCC healthcare construction spending (<strong>$45bn through 2025</strong>) prioritizes noise control, with acoustic plasterboards capturing <strong>60% market share</strong> in medical facility partitioning.</p><p><strong>Raw Material Price Volatility:</strong><br>
	Gypsum prices fluctuated <strong>18-25% quarterly</strong> in 2023 due to global supply chain disruptions, forcing manufacturers to implement <strong>quarterly price adjustments</strong>âa practice previously uncommon in this sector.</p><p><strong>Installation Complexity:</strong><br>
	Proper acoustic plasterboard installation requires specialized laborâa challenge in markets like Oman where <strong>65% of contractors</strong> still rely on conventional drywall techniques, leading to suboptimal performance claims.</p><p><strong>Substitute Product Competition:</strong><br>
	Traditional insulation materials maintain <strong>35% market share</strong> in cost-sensitive projects, although their inferior acoustic performance (<strong>40% lower NRC ratings</strong>) is gradually shifting preference to advanced plasterboard solutions.</p><p><strong>1. Smart Acoustic Solutions:</strong><br>
Integration of IoT-enabled plasterboards with <strong>real-time sound monitoring</strong> capabilities presents a $28 million opportunity by 2027. Early adopters like Dulsco in UAE are piloting these in smart city projects.</p><p><strong>2. Eco-friendly Formulations:</strong><br>
Recycled-content acoustic boards grew <strong>42% in 2023</strong> as LEED-certified projects increased. Manufacturers are respondingâKnauf's new ECO Board contains <strong>93% recycled material</strong> while maintaining 55dB insulation.</p><p><strong>3. Prefabricated Modular Construction:</strong><br>
Off-site construction methods adopted for <strong>79% of Saudi giga-projects</strong> prefer factory-installed acoustic solutions, creating $19m in prefabricated panel demand annually through 2028.</p><p><strong>Thickness Customization:</strong><br>
	While 13mm boards dominate (<strong>62% share</strong>), demand for ultra-thin 10mm variants grew <strong>27%</strong> in high-value commercial spaces where every centimeter counts.</p><p><strong>Composite Material Innovation:</strong><br>
	New plasterboard-core hybrids featuring <strong>aerogel and cork layers</strong> achieve 60dB sound reduction at 30% reduced weightânow specified in <strong>18% of premium projects</strong>.</p><p><strong>Regional Manufacturing Expansion:</strong><br>
	Local production capacity grew <strong>35% since 2021</strong>, with National Gypsum (UAE) and Gypsemna (Saudi) commissioning new dedicated acoustic board lines to reduce import dependence.</p><p>The market features a mix of global leaders and regional specialists:</p><p><strong>Knauf Gips KG</strong> and <strong>Saint-Gobain Gyproc</strong> dominate with <strong>58% combined market share</strong>, leveraging their technical expertise in high-performance acoustic solutions. Regional players like <strong>Mada Gypsum</strong> (Saudi) and <strong>Gypsemna</strong> (UAE) are gaining ground through:</p><p><strong>By Product Type:</strong></p><p><strong>By Application:</strong></p><p><strong>By Country:</strong></p><p>The UAE continues to lead with <strong>43% of regional demand</strong>, driven by Dubai's construction pipeline. Saudi Arabia's share grew from 22% to 28% since 2021, fueled by NEOM and Red Sea Project requirements. Qatar shows steady demand due to FIFA World Cup legacy developments, while Kuwait and Oman represent emerging opportunities with <strong>15-18% annual growth</strong>.</p><p>This press release summarizes findings from the <em>Middle East Acoustic Plasterboard Market Research Report 2024-2030</em>, providing comprehensive analysis of market size, growth drivers, competitive landscape, and emerging trends.
